This project utilizes hypothetical data from a ecommerce company with diverse customer bases worldwide.

The primary objective is having an insight of the actual data using sql and tableau as tools
and answering the following questions. 

    1- What was the company's revenue?
    2- Which items were the top-selling products?
    3- How can customer segmentation help identify active, potential, and lost customers?
    4- Utilizing Tableau to visually present insights derived from the preceding analyses.
